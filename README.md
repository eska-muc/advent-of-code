# Advent of Code 2024

My code for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

For every day the structure is like this

```
2024
├── 01
│   ├── sample.txt
│   ├── input.txt
│   ├── part1.py
│   ├── part2.py
│   ├── result.txt
```

| File       | Description                             |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| sample.txt | The sample input of the day's puzzle    |
| input.txt  | My input data for the day's puzzle      |
| result.txt | My results for the day's puzzle         |
| part1.py   | Solution for part 1 of the day's puzzle |
| part2.py   | Solution for part 2 of the day's puzzle |

In the python scripts I've usually defined one variable 'filename' which controls if the sample.txt or the input.txt is used as input.

Remark: although I'm normally supporting the thesis that the one who copies loses (german: "wer kopiert, verliert"), in this repository part2.py mostly evolved from a copy of part1.py
